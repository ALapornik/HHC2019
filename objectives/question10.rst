    Oh thank you! It's so nice to be back in my own head again. Er, alone.

    By the way, have you tried to get into the crate in the Student Union? It has an interesting set of locks.

    There are funny rhymes, references to perspective, and odd mentions of eggs!

    And if you think the stuff in your browser looks strange, you should see the page source...

    Special tools? No, I don't think you'll need any extra tooling for those locks.

    BUT - I'm pretty sure you'll need to use *Chrome's developer tools* for that one.

    Or sorry, you're a *Firefox* fan?

    Yeah, *Safari*'s fine too - I just have an ineffible hunger for a physical Esc key.

    *Edge*? That's cool. Hm? No no, I was thinking of an unrelated thing.

    *Curl* fan? Right on! Just remember: the Windows one doesn't like double quotes.

    Old school, huh? Oh sure - I've got what you need right here...
