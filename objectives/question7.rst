Solution

Go to Minty's dorm. You'll see Krampus moving into the closet. If you go into tha closet, there is a `lock <https://thisisit.elfu.org/>`_ on the door.

.. note:: Minty has a very messy closet. May smell bad.

On Minty's desk you'll find the `Key Bitter <https://key.elfu.org/>`_.

Krampus has the key hung on his belt. Find the picture in the Sources (in Chrome Dev Tools), or be a true spy and use the snipping tool or :kbd:`PrtSc` to get your own photo (not so subtle reference to the talk here).

Using the templates in the git repository, you can get an estimation of the code/bits.

From there, it's all about cutting multiple keys until you find the one that fits in the lock. [#f1]_

The final pattern is **122520**
