Hint

**Professor Banas:**
    Hi, I'm Dr. Banas, professor of Cheerology at Elf University.
    This term, I'm teaching "HOL 404: The Search for Holiday Cheer in Popular Culture," and I've had quite a shock!
    I was at home enjoying a nice cup of Gl√∏gg when I had a call from Kent, one of my students who interns at the Elf U SOC.
    Kent said that my computer has been hacking other computers on campus and that I needed to fix it ASAP!
    If I don't, he will have to report the incident to the boss of the SOC.
    Apparently, I can find out more information from this website https://splunk.elfu.org/ with the username: elf / Password: elfsocks.
    I don't know anything about computer security. Can you please help me?
