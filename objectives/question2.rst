    Date: February 28, 2019
    
    To the Administration, Faculty, and Staff of Elf University
    17 Christmas Tree Lane
    North Pole

    From: A Concerned and Aggrieved Character

    Subject: **DEMAND**: Spread Holiday Cheer to Other Holidays and Mythical Characters… OR
    ELSE!


    Attention All Elf University Personnel,

    It remains a constant source of frustration that Elf University and the entire operation at the
    North Pole focuses exclusively on Mr. S. Claus and his year-end holiday spree. We URGE
    you to consider lending your considerable resources and expertise in providing merriment,
    cheer, toys, candy, and much more to other holidays year-round, as well as to other mythical
    characters.

    For centuries, we have expressed our frustration at your lack of willingness to spread your
    cheer beyond the inaptly-called “Holiday Season.” There are many other perfectly fine
    holidays and mythical characters that need your direct support year-round.

    If you do not accede to our demands, we will be forced to take matters into our own hands.
    We do not make this threat lightly. You have less than six months to act demonstrably.

    Sincerely,

    --A Concerned and Aggrieved Character
