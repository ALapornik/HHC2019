    Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. Welcome to Elf U!
    I'm glad you're here. I'm the target of a terrible trick.
    Pepper Minstix is at it again, sticking me in a text editor.
    Pepper is forcing me to learn ed.
    Even the hint is ugly. Why can't I just use Gedit?
    Please help me just quit the grinchy thing.
